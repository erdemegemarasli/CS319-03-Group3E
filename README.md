**Project Topic**: A strategy desktop game inspired by the board game: "Walls&Warriors".

**Brief Description of the board-game "WALLS AND WARRIORS**

This game contains:
a game-board, 
1 high-tower piece, 
3 blue-knights, 
4 red-knights and 
4 different wall shapes. 
	There are many predefined challenges in the board-game which indicate how to place (some) walls, high-towers and knights. One may not need to use all the objects. After correct placement of the objects as indicated in the specific level, the player has to place the pieces in such a manner that all the red knights are kept outside the walls and all the blue knights are placed inside the walls. Also, the castle must be closed on all sides and red knights can never be walled in, meaning they cannot be surrounded by walls on all 4 sides. A challenge is solved once all these objectives are completed. There is only one solution of placement of the pieces; these solutions are found at the end of the booklet. 



**Project Description & Requirements** 

In this project we are aiming to develop a game which is inspired by the box game “Walls&Warriors” by Smart Games. 
The goal of the game is that the player should protect her/his castle with his/her knights by building walls. 
 
Contents/Components of the game:
Virtual game-board
4 or more different wall shapes will be given to the player to 
build the walls to keep the castle and friendly knights inside the walls, 
1 castle tower as the base, 
3 or more side-knights (blue), 
4 or more enemy-knights (red). 
We are planning to add extra modes (classical-level design-campaign) to our application. 
Upgrades will be decided later.

In the classical mode of our application, 
there are various patterns that player can choose and based on the desired pattern, 
enemy warriors and player’s warriors are placed. 
Initially, the player should pick up the pattern which he/she want to challenge him/herself. 
Regarding that choice, the game will be set up; 
the castle tower and knights will be built on to the virtual game board within this pattern, 
the game will be ready to play. 
The player should analyze wisely then build walls to protect the castle and side-knights. 
Also, the enemy knights should be kept outside of the walls to pass the levels.
Moreover, we are planning to add another mode that the player can make the level design of pattern, 
number of knights own. 
In this mode, there will be an empty virtual game board 
that the player can decide how many knights and where they will be placed.

In campaign mode, we are planning to add stories to levels to make the game more impressive; 
we will show a story to our player at the beginning of the game; 
while the player is playing, 
there will be popups to give strategy to the player.
Moreover, there will be more roles in this mode, other than knights. 
We are planning to add characters such as mercenaries with different powers. 
In this way, if the player can reach these characters, 
these characters interact with each other and flow of events in the game will change. 
Also, we are planning to add time option that 
the user should finish the game in this decided time to win and pass the level.

In the map designer mode, 
players will be able to create their own patterns using the same objects in "The Wall".
As template,
the base platform of the classic game will be used and players will create 
their patterns by putting knights, walls and castles as their wishes.
We are planning to check these created patterns whether they have a distinct solution or not.
The successful patterns created by players will be added to the player's game.
Moreover,
our aim is to make the game modifiable and allow users to have a 
different perspective towards the game and concept of strategy. 
By preparing the map designer mode,
desktop game "The Wall" will present an additional mode that 
cannot be found in the board game.  

**What are the differences between "The Wall" and "Walls&Warriors" ?** 

What makes "The Wall" different from the original "Walls&Warriors" is that
our game offers various new game modes. The players will be able to
race with time in the challenge mode while they can test 
their creativity by producing maps in the map designer mode. There also 
exists the campaign mode, which offers storylines and different maps
to attract the players.
